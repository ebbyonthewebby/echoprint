# EchoPrint Documentation

## Abstract

EchoPrint is an Arduino-based hardware system for the Ender 3 and Ender 3 Pro 3D printers. This system is meant to act as a screen reader for the built in LCD screen on the printer. 

## Preface
The SainSmart Ender-3 3D Printer User Guide is designed for the Ender-3 users to start their printing journey. Even if you are familiar with 3D printing technology, we still recommend that you read through this guide, as there is lots of important information about the Ender-3 for you to get a better 3D printing experience. To achieve that, you can refer to the following materials:
