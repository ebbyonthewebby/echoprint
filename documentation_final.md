# EchoPrint Documentation

## READ ME

EchoPrint is an Arduino-based hardware and software system for the Ender 3 and Ender 3 Pro 3D printers to enable 3D printing for those visually disabled creators. This system has screen reader for the built in LCD screen on the printer and safety guards.

Refer to Quick Start below to get started.

## Intro
The EchoPrint User Guide below is designed for easy screenreader navigation of the creation and usage of the EchoPrint. It is meant to accompany the Ender-3's SainSmart 3D Printer User Guide and be used with a pre-built and set-up Ender-3 printer.

## Quick Start

Follow the steps below to replicate the EchoPrint system.

1. Refer to Assembly below to build the Hardware Elements.

2. Upload code to components.

3. Set-Up.

4. Navigate 3D Printer Menu

5. Print using printing guides below.
